In this lab, I simulated various cyber attack scenarios and monitored the resulting logs and incidents in Azure Sentinel. These simulations included an Azure AD brute force attack, an MSSQL brute force attempt, a malware outbreak using the EICAR file, and a privilege escalation event involving Key Vault secret retrieval. Additionally, I triggered firewall tampering and excessive password reset attempts. Each incident was carefully observed and analyzed to understand how Sentinel detects and alerts on these security threats, showcasing my ability to respond to real-world attack scenarios in a SOC environment.
